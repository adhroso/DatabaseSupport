Technological advancements have enabled us to record a variety of data and sources. When collecting the data, sometimes it has to be processed right away, and other times it has to be stored in a data warehouse for later processing. One of the mechanisms for storing data is databases. 

In this assignment, we will connect to public database, extract weather information and visualize the patterns by changing different parameters.

Analysis: During our analysis, we observed that all three parameters have positive confounding effects (correlated).
